A process is a scheduled CPU activity caused by a user or system’s itself. For example, a word
processor, a Web browser, and an e-mail package. Even if a user can execute one program at a time,
the operating system may need to support its own internal programmed activities such as memory
management, etc. All these activities are similar, so they are called processes. Prioritizing processes
is crucial for most of the operating systems. In real-time operating systems, some low priority
processes (i.e. Web browser) need to be preempted and replaced by some other higher priority
processes (i.e. memory management) to guarantee that higher priority processes run firstly. To
simplify this process, ready-lists of operating systems are sometimes sorted according to the priority
of processes.

You are supposed to create a prioritized process ready list. A textbook based
Linked List and Process class implementations are provided to assist you.
You should add and implement a function called template <typename T> void
prioritized_insert(T& new_item) to the LinkedList class. 

This function must make some checks before
inserting the element into the list to keep the list sorted in descending order according to the
Processes’ priority. High priority means high importance and vice versa.

Your second job is to create a main function that generates an output similar to the sample run by
using the provided header files. In other words;
1. you should create a prioritized linked list for processes,
2. add some predefined processes to the list in the main,
3. finally, print the contents of the list according to the sample run.

Do not change anything in the header files except for the function that you have been asked to
write!

of your total grade.
Sample run 
Inserting ->
PROCESS NAME: Process 0
PROCESS ID: 0
PROCESS PRIORITY: 54
Inserting ->
PROCESS NAME: Process 1
PROCESS ID: 1
PROCESS PRIORITY: 24
Inserting ->
PROCESS NAME: Process 2
PROCESS ID: 2
PROCESS PRIORITY: 45
Inserting ->
PROCESS NAME: Process 3
PROCESS ID: 3
PROCESS PRIORITY: 63
Inserting ->
PROCESS NAME: Process 4
PROCESS ID: 4
PROCESS PRIORITY: 14
Currently there are 5 processes in the linked list.
Processes in the linked list that are sorted by their priorities are as
follows:
PROCESS NAME: Process 3
PROCESS ID: 3
PROCESS PRIORITY: 63
PROCESS NAME: Process 0
PROCESS ID: 0
PROCESS PRIORITY: 54
PROCESS NAME: Process 2
PROCESS ID: 2
PROCESS PRIORITY: 45
PROCESS NAME: Process 1
PROCESS ID: 1
PROCESS PRIORITY: 24
PROCESS NAME: Process 4
PROCESS ID: 4
PROCESS PRIORITY: 14
